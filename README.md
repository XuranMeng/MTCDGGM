# Multi-Task Covariance-Dependent Gaussian Graphical Model

This repository contains the implementation of our methods in **MATLAB**.

## Structure

- **`simulations/`**  
  Contains all codes and packages for simulation studies.

- **`real_data/`**  
  Real data analysis. Readers may directly use the same packages and functions provided in the `simulations/` folder.

## Notes

- All workflows are organized into sequential scripts (see README inside `simulations/` for details).  
- For real data experiments, the observed matrices $\mathbf{Z}$ and $\mathbf{U}$ are used in place of synthetic data.
