# Real Data Experiments

The real data experiment codes are written in **MATLAB**.  
We follow the same workflow as in the simulation studies, but instead of synthetic data, we use the observed matrices $\mathbf{Z}$ and $\mathbf{U}$.  

The procedure includes:  
1. Loading the real dataset.  
2. Running the regression and debiasing steps (same as in the simulation part).  
3. Reporting the final results.
